            <h1 style="color: rgb(19, 60, 94); margin-bottom: 10px;">Enhanced IoT Security through Zero Trust Architecture Implementation</h1>
            <h3 style="line-height: 1.3; color: rgb(7, 22, 34); margin-bottom: 10px;">In today‚Äôs IoT-driven world, security is critical. This project implements a cutting-edge Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to ensure that no device is trusted by default, enhancing IoT network security with real-time, dynamic controls.</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.4;">üîë Project Highlights:

              Raspberry Pi 3B: Configured as a secure router for policy enforcement.
              Python Security Scripts: Real-time device trust evaluation and access control.
              Machine Learning Model: Autoencoder-based anomaly detection for proactive threat mitigation.
              Dynamic Access Control: Lightweight, scalable, and superior to traditional methods.
              üîπ Key Benefits:
              ‚úî Zero Trust access control for robust security.
              ‚úî Real-time threat detection and prevention.
              ‚úî Scalable implementation for IoT ecosystems.

              üéØ My Contributions:
              
              Machine Learning Model Development: Trained and implemented an autoencoder-based anomaly detection model to identify unusual network patterns. Preprocessed data, fine-tuned the model, and compared its performance with other Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, including One Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forrest, LSTM, and GRU, ensuring effectiveness for real-time IoT security.
              
              User Interface Development: Built a React-based interface to display real-time data on connected devices, trust scores, and security statuses, enabling intuitive monitoring and policy management.
              
              üôè Acknowledgments:
              Grateful to my group members, Abheetha Jayasinghe and Masha Pitumpe, for their dedication, and to my supervisors, Mr. Saahith Ahamed Rafiudeen, Dr. Kushan Sudheera Kalupahana Liyanage, and Dr. Malka N. Halgamuge, for their invaluable guidance and mentorship from the beginning until to the success of the project.
              
              Excited to carry this experience forward into the fields of cybersecurity, IoT, and software engineering!
